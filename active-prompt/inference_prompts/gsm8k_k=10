He is currently working for three clients, with the first client paying him half the amount of money he currently has on his dashboard once the job is done. The second client will pay him 2/5 times more money than the first client once Baylor finishes his work. The third client will pay him twice the amount of money the first and second clients pay him together once he finishes the job. How much money will Baylor have in his dashboard after all the clients pay him for his work?\nA:",
            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. To calculate how much money will Baylor have in his leaderboard after all clients pay him for this work, we need to know the amount of payment from each client and add them together with original value on the leaderboard. The first client will pay Baylor 1/2*$4000=$2000. The second client will pay Baylor 2/5 times more money than the first client, a total of 2/5*$2000 = $800. The total amount of money the second client will pay Baylor once the job is done is $2000+$800 = $2800. The total amount of money the first and the second client will pay Baylor after their work is finished is $2800+$2000 = $4800. The third client will pay him twice the amount of money the first and second clients pay him together, a total of 2*$4800 = $9600. Together, the three clients will pay Baylor $9600+$4800 = $14400 once he finishes their jobs. In his dashboard, Baylor will have $14400+$4000 = $18400.",

            "question": "Q: Josh and Anna were both born on August 17th, but in different years. To consolidate celebrations they also got married on August 17 when Josh turned 22. If today they're celebrating 30 years of marriage and their combined age is exactly 5 times what Josh's age was when they married, how old was Anna when they got married?\nA:",
	        "rationale": "Let's think step by step. To calculate how old was Anna when they got married, we have to know their combined age, Josh's age after 30 years, and Anna's age after 30 years from their marriage. Since their combined age is 5 times Josh's age when he got married, their combined age is 5 * 22 = 110 years. Josh must be 30 years older than his age when they got married, so he is 22 + 30 = 52 years old now. Therefore, Anna's current age will be 110 - 52 = 58 years. If they married 30 years ago, Anna must have been 58 - 30 = 28 years old when they married.",

She spent 10 minutes downloading the Mac version, only to realize she needed the Windows version, which took three times as long to download. During her first call, the audio glitched twice for 4 minutes each time and the video glitched once for 6 minutes. She spent twice as long talking without glitches as with glitches. How much time did Mary spend downloading Zoom and talking in total?\nA:",
    	    "rationale": "Let's think step by step. To calculate how much time did Mary spend downloading Zoom and talking in total, we need to know the downloading time of the Mac version, downloading time of the Windows version, the total time of audio glitches and video glitches, and the total glitch-free time. The Windows version's downloading time is three times that of the Mac version, which is 3 * 10 = 30 minutes. The total time of audio glitches and video glitches is 4 minutes/glitch * 2 audio glitches + 6 minutes audio glitches = 14 minutes. The glitch-free time is twice as long as the time with glitch, which is 2 * 14 = 28 minutes. The total time Mary spent downloading Zoom and talking is to add all together, 10 minutes + 30 minutes + 14 minutes + 28 minutes =  82 minutes.",

She also has to pay the water bill and the electric bill separately. She wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills and she has twice as many job applications as rebates to mail. How many stamps does she need if everything needs 1 stamp except the electric bill, which needs 2?\nA:",
	        "rationale": "Let's think step by step. To calculate how many stamps does Valerie needs to put on the envelopes she is about to mail, we need to know the number of thank you cards for birthday presents, the number of bills, the number of mail-in rebates, the number of job applications, and the total number of mails to send. Since there are three people to thank, the number of thank you cards is 3. There are two bills which are the water bill and the electric bill. The number of mail is 3 more than the number of bills, which is 3 + 2 = 5. The number of job applications is twice as many as main-in rebates, which is 2 * 5 = 10 applications. The total number of mails to send is 3 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 20 pieces of mail to send. Each mail needs 1 stamp but electric bills, which need 2 stamps. So she needs 20 + 1 = 21 stamps.",

To calculate how many more geese than ducks remain at the park, we need to know the number of geese initially at the park, the number of ducks after 4 ducks arrived, the number of geese left, and the number of geese remains. The number of geese initially at the park is ten less than twice as many geese as ducks, which is 2*25 - 10 = 40 geese. The number of ducks in the park after 4 ducks arrived is 25 + 4 = 29 ducks. The number of geese left is 5 less than 15 geese which are 15 - 5 = 10 geese left. The number of geese remaining is 40 - 10 = 30 geese remaining.

The Sunday paper weighs twice as much. He is supposed to deliver 250 papers a day. He doesn't deliver them for ten weeks. If one ton of paper recycles for $20, how much did he make?\nA:",
	        "rationale": "Let's think step by step. To calculate how much did John make if one ton of paper was recycled for $20, we need to know the weight of a weekly delivery of the papers in pounds, the total weight of paper delivered in 10 weeks, and the total weight of paper in tons. The weekly delivery of a paper consists of 6 days of 8 ounces of paper and one day of 2*8 = 16 ounces of paper, so the weekly weight of paper is 6 * 8  + 16 = 64 ounces, which is 64/16=4 pounds. Since John needs to deliver 250 papers a day, the total weight of paper delivered in a week is 4 * 250 = 1000 pounds. The total weight of papers in 10 weeks is 10 * 1000 = 10000 pounds. The weight of paper in tons is 10000/2000 = 5 tons. So he makes 5 * 20 = $100 from recycling the paper.",

If the farmer also owns 9 horses and each horse consumes 3 bales of hay a day, how many bales of hay would the farmer have left by the end of December if he starts feeding them this year's hay beginning the first day of September?\nA:",

To calculate how many bales of hay would the farmer have left by the end of December if he starts feeding the horse this year's hay beginning the first day of September, we need to know the number of bales of hay that can harvest from each acre of grass, the number of acres of grass the farmer has this year, the total number of bales of hay can harvest per month, the number of acres of grass the farmer has this year, the total number of bales of hay can harvest this year, the number of days to feed the horse from September to December, the number of bales of hay his house eats per day, and the total number of bales of hay his houses will eat. The number of bales of hay that can harvest from each acre of grass is 560/5 = 112 bales of hay each month. The number of acres of grass the farmer has this year is 7 + 5 = 12 acres of grass. The number of bales of hay that can harvest per month from the 12 acres of grass is 12 * 112 = 1344 bales of hay per month.

The number of bales of hay his horse eats each day is 3 * 9 = 27. The total number of bales of hay his horses consumed in 122 days is 27 * 122 = 3294.
