This week, Norman earned more than twice as much as he did last week. If he sold A bicycles last week and Y bicycles this week, which of the following statements must be true? I. y > 2x II. y > x III. y > 3 Answer Choices: (A) I only (B) II only (C) I and II (D) II and III (E) I, II, and III\nA:",
            "rationale": "Let's think step by step. This is kind of like doing your taxes, lets summarize the data in terms of bike sales and salary. 0 Bikes - $20. 6 Bikes - $56. 12 Bikes - $128. More than 12 bikes - 128 + 18*(a-12) where x is the total number of bikes sold (when a>12). A = cycles sold last week. AS = Salary last week. Y = cycles sole this week. YS = Salary this week. given YS>2AS. Let's test all statements with A=0;. AS = 20. YS >40. True when Y = 4. satisfies all the statements but we can only be sure of iii as Y will only increase from here. So iii must be true. Eliminate A,B,C. lets test all statements with A=1;. AS = 26. YS>52. True when Y=6. Still satisfies all the statements - Nothing achieved. lets test all statements with A=6. AS = 56. YS>112. True when Y = 11. This proves statement i wrong, hence eliminate E so we are left with D.",
