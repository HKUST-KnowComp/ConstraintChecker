PersonX occupy PersonY position, thus, PersonX want PersonY want to aid in position
Let's think step by step. When PersonX occupy PersonY position, it means PersonY already worked at this position and has experience to do the job. Therefore, it's likely that PersonX want PersonY to aid PerosonX when PersonX is in that job position

PersonX see that, thus as an result, PersonX want a pet
Let's think step by step. In this context, we can refer the word 'that' as some activity where people play with their pet. Therefore, it stimulates PersonX's desire to have a pet
