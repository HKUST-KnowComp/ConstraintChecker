4. False. Because, the inference implies that if PersonX misbehaves, then the event of PersonX misbehaving will not happen.
##5

1. D_c = 'event'
2. No (because the ordered pair (D_c, D_i) = ('event', 'event') is not valid)
3. Yes
4. False. Because, result of 2 is No.
##6

1. D_c = 'event'
2. Yes (because the ordered pair (D_c, D_i) = ('event', 'event') is valid)
3. Yes
4. False. Because, the event of PersonX getting the job will not happen if PersonX has little experience.
##7

1. D_c = 'event'
2. No (because the ordered pair (D_c, D_i) = ('event', 'event') is not valid)
3. Yes
4. False. Because, result of 2 is No.
##8

1. D_c = 'event'
2. Yes (because the ordered pair (D_c, D_i) = ('event', 'event') is valid)
3. Yes
4. False. Because, the inference implies that if PersonY grow pale, then PersonX will not look pale.
##9
1. D_c = 'event'
2. Yes (because the ordered pair (D_c, D_i) = ('event', 'event') is valid)
3. Yes
4. False. Because, the inference implies that if PersonX is careful, the event PersonX see a opening will not happen.
##0

1. D_c = 'event'
2. No (because the ordered pair (D_c, D_i) = ('event', 'event') is not valid)
3. Yes
4. False. Because, result of 2 is No.
##1

1. D_c = 'event'
2. Yes (because the ordered pair (D_c, D_i) = ('event', 'event') is valid)
3. Yes
4. True. Because 1) "PersonX see" means PersonX is able to observe the event/action, and 2) "some see" means some people are able to observe the event/action.
