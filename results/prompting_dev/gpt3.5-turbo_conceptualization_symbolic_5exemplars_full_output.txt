The event PersonX achieve that will not happen, if PersonX could have
1. D_c = 'mental state'
2. R(D_c, D_i) = R('mental state', 'event') = No
3. No (T is unclear about what 'PersonX could have')
4. False. Because result of 2 is No.
The event PersonX run away will not happen, if PersonY would better hurry
1. D_c = 'event'
2. R(D_c, D_i) = R('event', 'event') = Yes
3. Yes
4. True. Because if PersonY hurries, it can prevent PersonX from running away, which means the event of PersonX running away will not happen.
The event PersonX know PersonY will not happen, if y don
1. D_c = 'mental state'
2. R(D_c, D_i) = R('mental state', 'event') = Yes
3. No (T is unclear about what 'y don' means)
4. False. Because result of 3 is No.
The event PeopleX be gon na take pete there will not happen, if PeopleY do not call PersonX bitch
1. D_c = 'event'
2. R(D_c, D_i) = R('event', 'event') = Yes
3. No (T is unclear about the relationship between PeopleY's action and the event)
4. False. Because result of 3 is No.
The event PersonX send PersonY home will not happen, if now it be up
1. D_c = 'event'
2. R(D_c, D_i) = R('event', 'event') = Yes
3. No (T is unclear about what 'now it be up' means)
4. False. Because result of 3 is No.
The event PersonX be misbehave will not happen, if PeopleX be misbehave
1. D_c = 'event'
2. R(D_c, D_i) = R('event', 'event') = Yes
3. Yes
4. False. Because the inference is not logically sound and does not make sense. The occurrence of one person misbehaving does not necessarily prevent another person from misbehaving.
The event PersonX do not think PersonY will not happen, if there be actually something
1. D_c = 'event'
2. R(D_c, D_i) = R('event', 'event') = Yes
3. No (T is unclear about what 'there be actually something' means)
4. False. Because result of 3 is No.
The event PersonX get this job will not happen, if PersonX have little experience
1. D_c = 'mental state'
2. R(D_c, D_i) = R('mental state', 'event') = No
3. Yes
4. False. Because result of 2 is No.
The event that be deep will not happen, if PersonX probably deserve it
1. D_c = 'mental state'
2. R(D_c, D_i) = R('mental state', 'event') = Yes
3. No (T is unclear about what 'PersonX probably deserve it' means)
4. False. Because result of 3 is No.
The event PersonX look pale will not happen, if PersonY grow pale
1. D_c = 'event'
2. R(D_c, D_i) = R('event', 'event') = Yes
3. Yes
4. True. Because if PersonY grows pale, it is likely that PersonX will not look pale as the attention will be on PersonY's paleness.
The event PersonX see a opening will not happen, if PersonX just have to be careful
1. D_c = 'mental state'
2. R(D_c, D_i) = R('mental state', 'event') = Yes
3. Yes
4. True. Because the inference suggests that if PersonX is careful, the event of seeing an opening will not happen, implying that PersonX's mental state of being careful affects the likelihood of the event happening.
The event PersonX wish for it will not happen, if it be desirable
1. D_c = 'mental state'
2. R(D_c, D_i) = R('mental state', 'event') = Yes
3. Yes
4. True. Because the inference suggests that if something is desirable, then it is unlikely to happen even if PersonX wishes for it. This is a common belief and does not have any ambiguity in its meaning.
The event PersonX see includes the event/action that some see
1. D_c = 'event'
2. R(D_c, D_i) = R('event', 'event') = Yes
3. No (T is unclear about who or what is being referred to by 'some')
4. False. Because result of 3 is No.
