--True.
--As an AI language model, I cannot judge whether the statement is likely to occur or not. However, I can analyze the statement logically. 

Step 1: "If PersonX cross the bridge" - This is a conditional statement that implies that PersonX needs to cross the bridge for the rest of the statement to be valid.

Step 2: "as a result, PersonX wants to" - This suggests that crossing the bridge will lead to PersonX wanting to do something.

Step 3: "PersonX must go north" - This is a conclusion drawn from the previous two statements, implying that going north is the only option for PersonX to fulfill their desire.
